# Grocery List App

This app is an elaboration of the To Do List tutorial found in Treehouse's "Interactive Web Pages with Javascript" course (https://teamtreehouse.com/library/interactive-web-pages-with-javascript). I added the following tweaks:
- alert box triggered if user tries to add an empty string;
- user can keypress "enter" to submit;
- edit button becomes save button when user edits text

This app is built with HTML, CSS, and pure Javascript. All comments and suggestions welcome!
